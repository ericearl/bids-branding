# BIDS Branding Guide
Welcome to the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) Brand Guide repository! This repository contains all the necessary guidelines, assets, and documentation to maintain a consistent and professional visual identity for BIDS. Our brand guide ensures that all representations of BIDS across various platforms are unified, and professional, and reflect our organization's core values and objectives.

## Introduction
BIDS is an essential standard for organizing and sharing neuroimaging and behavioral data, created by the community for the community. Consistent branding helps us communicate our mission effectively and maintain a strong presence in the scientific community. This brand guide provides detailed instructions on how to use BIDS visual assets correctly.

## About BIDS
Neuroimaging experiments result in complex data that can be arranged in many different ways. For a long time, there was no consensus on how to organize and share data obtained in neuroimaging experiments. Even two researchers working in the same lab could opt to arrange their data differently. The lack of consensus leads to misunderstandings and wasted time on rearranging data or rewriting scripts expecting a certain structure. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) describes a simple and easy-to-adopt way of organizing neuroimaging and behavioral data, ensuring consistency and improving data sharing and collaboration.

## Brand Objective
The BIDS brand design creates a unique, recognizable, and user-friendly visual identity that accurately represents the organization's values and goals. The brand design communicates professionalism, innovation, and trustworthiness, reflecting BIDS' commitment to simplifying and standardizing the organization of neuroimaging and behavioral data. The brand design also ensures consistency in the use of all BIDS elements among all users of BIDS visual elements.
